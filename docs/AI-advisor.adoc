= Local AI Component
:icons: unicode

== Purpose

A local AI module may be included to assist in interpreting multi-sensor anomalies.  
It does not replace deterministic logic. It provides explanatory context and pattern recognition over time.

== Role in System

* Input: structured telemetry from sensors (binary states, confidence, persistence).
* Output: classification of anomaly type, brief explanation, and uncertainty estimate.
* Scope: advisory only. The system must operate correctly without it.

== Data Flow

1. Sensors produce periodic JSON records.
2. Core logic applies deterministic rules and scores.
3. AI module optionally receives the last N records (sliding window).
4. Model returns interpretation text and a label.
5. Output is appended to logs and UI.

== Model Requirements

Local execution, bounded resources, predictable behavior.  
Small transformer or tree-based model acceptable.  
Training starts from synthetic patterns and iterates on collected logs.

== Behavior

The AI correlates signals across time and domains to reduce false positives and highlight plausible causes (local outage, regional infrastructure issue, RF environment anomaly, or sensor fault).

It is not allowed to control sensors or trigger emergency actions.

== Failure Handling

If the AI component is unavailable or produces invalid output, the system continues using deterministic logic only. Logs record the absence.

== Security

Offline inference only.  
No external network calls.  
Sandboxed execution.

== Summary

This module is an optional analytical layer. Its value is improved interpretation and operator clarity. Core sensing, scoring, and alert logic remain fully rule-based and independent.
