= Seismic Sensor Integration (Accelerometer + GNSS Hybrid)

This note describes how to add a **seismic sensing node** to the sentinel platform by integrating a low-cost accelerometer (and optionally GNSS displacement measurement), referencing the architecture of the Galileo-Terremoti project.

== Objectives

* Detect abrupt ground vibration using an accelerometer sensor.
* Correlate vibration events with radio/infrastructure anomalies.
* Use seismic input as contextual signal in the overall continuity monitoring system.

== Required Hardware

* A 3-axis accelerometer on a microcontroller or single-board computer (e.g., ADXL345, MPU-6050)  
* Raspberry Pi (or equivalent SBC) for local processing  
* Stable mounting to a fixed structure (wall, shelf)  
* Optional: GNSS module for displacement monitoring

== Integration Flow

1. Initialize accelerometer sensor, calibrate bias and offsets.  
2. Continuously sample sensor at defined rate (e.g., 50–200 Hz).  
3. Apply real-time filter to suppress normal/environmental vibrations (e.g., vehicle, HVAC).  
4. Detect “shake event” when acceleration norms exceed local threshold for defined period.  
5. On event detection: annotate system log with timestamp, amplitude, duration.  
6. Feed this event into the scoring engine alongside RF/infra signals.  
7. Use as cross-domain indicator: if infrastructure anomaly coincides with seismic event → mark as “likely natural disturbance”.

== Software Considerations

* Use lightweight driver or library for I²C/SPI interface.  
* Store a ring buffer of recent samples for post-event review.  
* Event detection algorithm might be STA/LTA or simple threshold+duration.  
* Timing must align with system clock for correlation with other sensor failures.

== Configuration & Thresholds

* Define baseline noise level (e.g., accelerometer RMS during quiet period).  
* Trigger threshold = baseline mean + N×standard_deviation (e.g., N=5).  
* Minimum event duration = e.g., 100ms.  
* Optional debounce time to avoid repeated triggers.  
* Periodic self-check: verify sensor still reporting, bias not drifting.

== Data Integration

* Annotated output: JSON record `{ "event_type": "seismic", "timestamp": "...", "peak_acc": ..., "duration_ms": ..., "sensor_id": "..."}`
* Scoring engine reads this input as one of many domain indicators.

== Failure & False-Positive Handling

* Mounting movement, heavy machinery, hammering are non-seismic triggers.  
* Do not treat accelerometer event alone as alert — only in cross-domain context.  
* Sensor failure: if no data for defined period → log “sensor offline” but do not escalate.

== Summary

By integrating an accelerometer (and optionally GNSS) you add a physical-vibration domain to the sentinel system. This enhances correlation possibilities without increasing reliance on external networks or services.
