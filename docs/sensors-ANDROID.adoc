= Reusing Smartphones as Sensors

== Introduction
Using the Android application *Sensor Stream*, old smartphones can be repurposed as low-cost sensor modules. These devices are capable of transmitting real-time readings from their internal sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, light, proximity, etc.) to a Raspberry Pi node via UDP.

The app performs a UDP broadcast on the local network (typically on a configurable port, default 5555).  
The Raspberry Pi listens on this port, processes incoming packets, and integrates the data stream into the global Doomsday telemetry flow.

== Motivation and Advantages

* **Hardware reuse:** extends the lifespan of obsolete but functional devices, reducing waste and costs.  
* **High sensor density:** smartphones integrate multiple precision sensors in a compact form factor.  
* **Scalability and modularity:** additional units can be easily added without structural changes.  
* **Autonomy:** internal batteries allow continued sensing even during local power outages.

== Software Integration

The Raspberry Pi runs a lightweight UDP listener that receives raw data from *Sensor Stream*.  
A minimal Python example:

[source,python]
----
import socket

UDP_IP = "0.0.0.0"
UDP_PORT = 5555

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))

print("Listening on", UDP_PORT)
while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
    print("Message from", addr, ":", data.decode())
----

The received data can then be:

* logged into a CSV file or local database;  
* used as input for vibration, seismic, or electromagnetic disturbance detection;  
* correlated with network telemetry to identify compound events (e.g., power loss + connectivity drop).

== Future Extensions

* Implement dedicated parsers for each sensor type.  
* Aggregate sensor data into a shared web dashboard.  
* Add encrypted and authenticated UDP transmission.  
* Enable alert triggers on anomalous readings (e.g., vibrations during a global disconnection).

== Conclusion

Repurposing smartphones as sensors perfectly fits the *Doomsday* philosophy — resilience, decentralization, and intelligent reuse of existing resources.  
Each old phone can become a small sensory node, helping make the network sentinel more sensitive, distributed, and sustainable.
