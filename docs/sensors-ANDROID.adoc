= Reusing Smartphones as Sensors
:revdate: 2025-11-05
:doctype: article

== Introduction
Using the Android application *Sensor Stream*, old smartphones can be repurposed as no-cost sensor modules. These devices are capable of transmitting real-time readings from their internal sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, light, proximity, etc.) to a Raspberry Pi node via UDP.

The app performs a UDP broadcast on the local network (typically on a configurable port, default 5000).  
The Raspberry Pi listens on this port, processes incoming packets, and integrates the data stream into the global Doomsday telemetry flow.

== Motivation and Advantages

* **Hardware reuse:** extends the lifespan of obsolete but functional devices, reducing waste and costs.  
* **High sensor density:** smartphones integrate multiple precision sensors in a compact form factor.  
* **Scalability and modularity:** additional units can be easily added without structural changes.  
* **Autonomy:** internal batteries allow continued sensing even during local power outages.

== Software Integration

The Raspberry Pi runs a lightweight WS listener that receives raw data from *Sensor Stream*:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import asyncio
import websockets
import socket
from base64 import b64decode
import wave
import json


def get_ip():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    try:
        s.connect(('10.255.255.255', 1))
        IP = s.getsockname()[0]
    except Exception:
        IP = '127.0.0.1'
    finally:
        s.close()
    return IP


hostname = socket.gethostname()
IPAddr = get_ip()
# Using 5000 as the default port but you can change based on your requirements
port = 5000
print("Your Computer Name is: " + hostname)
print("Your Computer IP Address is: " + IPAddr)
print(
    "* Enter {0}:{1} in the app.\n* Press the 'Set IP Address' button.\n* Select the sensors to stream.\n* Update the 'update interval' by entering a value in ms.".format(IPAddr, $


async def echo(websocket, path):
    async for message in websocket:
        if path == '/accelerometer':
            data = await websocket.recv()
            print(data)
            f = open("accelerometer.txt", "a")
            f.write(data+"\n")

....etc...

The received data can then be:

* logged into a CSV file or local database;  
* used as input for vibration, seismic, or electromagnetic disturbance detection;  
* correlated with network telemetry to identify compound events (e.g., power loss + connectivity drop).

== Future Extensions

* Implement dedicated parsers for each sensor type.  
* Aggregate sensor data into a shared web dashboard.  
* Add encrypted and authenticated UDP transmission.  
* Enable alert triggers on anomalous readings (e.g., vibrations during a global disconnection).

== Environmental and Physical Layer Monitoring

* **Vibration and seismic detection:**  
  Multiple repurposed smartphones positioned in different locations can record subtle ground vibrations.  
  Correlating these signals with network anomalies may reveal regional blackouts, infrastructure failures, or even earthquakes.

* **Electromagnetic disturbance sensing:**  
  The magnetometer readings can identify strong EM interference. In a distributed configuration, synchronized magnetometer data from multiple smartphones could effectively separate local noise from coherent geomagnetic variations, enabling the detection of solar-induced disturbances.

== Redundancy and Failure Analysis

* **Physical confirmation of digital anomalies:**  
  When a regional internet drop is detected, correlated accelerometer or magnetic anomalies from smartphones could confirm if it’s caused by physical events.

* **Fallback telemetry nodes:**  
  A smartphone can act as an emergency node — if the Raspberry Pi loses power or connectivity, the phone’s mobile data (4G/5G) could transmit minimal diagnostic data back to the central Doomsday network.

== Experimental and Research Applications

* **GPS signal stability tracking:**  
  Smartphones equipped with GPS can continuously record signal strength and compare it with expected satellite visibility, helping detect local *GPS jamming* or spoofing attempts.

* **Temperature and ambient light as proxy signals:**  
  Variations in temperature or light can provide context to external conditions — day/night cycles, heatwaves, or storms — potentially influencing network load or reliability.

* **Distributed synchronization experiments:**  
  Using the system clock and periodic sensor events, Sensor Stream nodes can test local synchronization accuracy compared to NTP, exploring how time drifts propagate under outage conditions.

== Summary

Repurposed Sensor Stream devices add a valuable physical sensing layer to the Doomsday network.  
They allow the system not only to *detect* digital anomalies, but to *interpret* them in the context of real-world events — making Doomsday an increasingly complete sentinel of both the network and its surrounding environment.
