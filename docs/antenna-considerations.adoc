= Antenna Considerations

This system prioritizes signal presence over precision. Antenna requirements are therefore modest. The objective is continuous reception of broad infrastructure signals across multiple services, using simple and widely available antennas.

== General Principles

* A broadband or compromise antenna is sufficient for detection.
* Absolute performance is not critical; consistency is.
* Small indoor antennas are acceptable where reception is stable.
* Placement affects results more than antenna type in most cases.
* Avoid highly directional antennas, as the goal is ambient sensing.

The system values stable baselines and anomaly detection rather than maximum gain.

== Practical Antenna Types

*Stock RTL-SDR telescopic antenna*  
Adequate for FM, DVB-T noise, GSM beacon presence, and ADS-B energy checks. Extend length to ~1/4 wavelength for band of interest when possible, but broad compromise positioning is acceptable.

*Simple wire or whip antennas*  
A short wire (~10–50 cm) connected to the SDR input can suffice indoors for FM and DVB-T detection.  
Not optimized, but consistent enough for threshold measurements.

*Small ADS-B whip (if available)*  
Useful but not required. The system does not decode ADS-B packets at this stage; only energy detection is needed.

*No external antenna for GNSS*  
GNSS lock check should be handled by an external GPS receiver module, not the SDR. The SDR only observes L-band noise characteristics. If using a GNSS module, a small ceramic patch or puck antenna is adequate.

== Placement Considerations

Indoor placement near a window typically provides stable baselines. Avoid:

* locations immediately next to large metal objects
* directly behind reinforced concrete
* placement near switching power supplies or Wi-Fi routers, if avoidable

The priority is repeatability rather than optimal SNR.

== Environmental Variability

Weak signals may fluctuate with:

* building construction
* time of day (ADS-B aircraft density)
* weather and seasonal foliage (minor effect)
* nearby consumer electronics

To manage this, thresholds should be learned from local conditions rather than assumed absolute values.

== Coax and Connectors

For short runs (<1 m), stock cables are adequate. Low-loss coax is not required. Adapters may introduce small loss but remain acceptable given the detection-only goal.

== Summary

A functional antenna arrangement for this project does not require specialized hardware. Stock DVB-T antennas, simple whips, or short wires provide sufficient capability. Stable placement and local baseline calibration are more important than antenna gain.
