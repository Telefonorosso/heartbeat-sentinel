= GNSS Spoofing & Jamming Detection
:icons: unicode

This document describes practical, defensive measures to detect GNSS spoofing and jamming
from a sentinel perspective. It emphasises that reliable detection benefits from an
additional, higher-quality piece of hardware (or multiple units) beyond a basic SDR + cheap GNSS receiver.

== Safety and Scope

This document is strictly defensive. It does not describe, enable, or provide technical
details for transmitting, spoofing, jamming, or otherwise interfering with GNSS systems.
Implementers must follow local laws and regulations. The guidance below focuses on
observability, correlation and conservative decision rules.

== Detection Goals

Detect anomalous GNSS behavior such as:
* **sudden large simultaneous loss of satellites (jamming-like)**
* **abrupt position or time discontinuities (possible spoofing)**
* **unrealistically uniform SNR/Doppler patterns across PRNs (suspicious)**
* **RF energy rises around GNSS carriers without corresponding valid receiver telemetry**

Reliable detection aims to discriminate between:
**receiver or antenna faults**
**local interference**
**propagation events (ionosphere)**
**intentional RF interference (jamming)**
**deliberate signal injection (spoofing)**

== Why extra hardware matters

A basic RTL-SDR and a consumer GNSS module provide limited signals:
**SDR ? coarse RF energy in L-band (good for loud, wideband jammers)
**consumer GNSS ? fix/no-fix, satellite count, coarse SNR (useful but limited)

Robust detection benefits from one or more of the following less-common items:

* **Full-feature GNSS receiver with raw observables** — provides per-PRN carrier-phase, pseudorange, C/N0 and Doppler. Raw observables are essential to detect subtle anomalies (e.g., inconsistent Doppler or phase behavior).
* **Second independent GNSS receiver (spatial separation)** — two colocated or slightly separated receivers provide cross-checks: consistent time/position but divergent observables indicate a receiver fault vs. true external event.
* **Multi-antenna array / direction-finding capability** — enables measuring angle-of-arrival changes; spoofers typically appear from one direction compared to many satellite directions.
* **Spectrum analyzer or high-dynamic-range SDR** — captures full-band IQ with better linearity and dynamic range than entry-level dongles, improving detection of narrowband or near-field interferers.
* **Stable reference clock ( disciplined oscillator )** — helps detect sudden time changes and reduces false positives from receiver clock issues.

These items increase cost/complexity but significantly improve detection fidelity.

== Defensive signals and heuristics (conceptual)

Monitor and correlate:
**RF-band energy around L1/L2 (SDR or spectrum analyzer)
**GNSS receiver telemetry: fix status, per-PRN SNR/C/N0, Doppler estimates, position/time residuals
**Persistence over time (require anomalies across multiple windows)
**Cross-domain corroboration (ADS-B, FM, GSM, power state) — intentional interference often correlates with other local anomalies

Conservative rule examples (concept, not exploit steps):
**Wideband L1 power rise + simultaneous drop in satellite count and SNR ? high confidence jamming indicator.
**Position/time jumps with PRN Doppler inconsistencies and uniform SNR across PRNs ? elevated spoofing suspicion.
**Loss of fix without L1 power rise ? likely receiver/antenna local fault.

Insist on repeat observations (e.g., 2–3 windows) before raising high-severity alerts.

== Logging and forensics

When an event is suspected, capture:
**recent GNSS raw observables (if available) or at least PRN/SNR/Doppler lists
**SDR short IQ dump (few seconds) around suspected time
**correlated sensor data (ADS-B counts, FM/DVB-T status, power sentinel, accelerometer)
**timestamps synchronized to system UTC

Preserve files for offline forensic analysis. Do not attempt active probing or countermeasures.

== Operational recommendations

**Calibrate baselines for satellite count, C/N0 and SDR noise floor over several days.
**Implement hysteresis and sliding-window confirmation to reduce false positives.
**Prefer detection policies that require multi-domain corroboration.
**Maintain a sensor-health monitor to differentiate sensor faults from external events.
**If deploying a second GNSS receiver, ensure independent supply and antenna placement to reduce common-mode local interference.

== Privacy, legality and ethics

**Do not attempt to test detection by transmitting or otherwise interfering with GNSS.
**Follow country-specific regulations on RF emissions and spectrum.
**Limit captured raw data sharing to necessary forensic teams; treat GPS/IQ dumps as potentially sensitive.

== Summary

Detecting GNSS spoofing/jamming reliably is feasible with a defensive architecture that:
**combines SDR and a proper GNSS receiver,
**uses additional higher-quality hardware (raw-observable GNSS receiver, second receiver or DF capability) when possible,
**emphasizes persistence, cross-domain corroboration, and logging for forensics.

This design minimizes false alarms while providing actionable evidence for operators.
