= Minimal System Packages (APT)

This document lists the minimal Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS packages required to operate the core sensing functions of the system.  
Packages are limited to essential radio utilities, terminal tools, and serial modem support.

== Base System Update

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
----

== Required SDR Utilities

RTL-SDR tools for carrier scanning and power spectral sampling.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y rtl-sdr
----

== Analysis Utilities

`awk` and `coreutils` are included by default on most Debian-based systems.  
`jq` is required only if exporting JSON logs.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y jq
----

== Modem / Serial Support

For AT command communication with USB modems.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y usb-modeswitch modemmanager
----

Note: `minicom` or `screen` are optional for manual testing and not required for automated scripts.

== Networking Tools

Used only for basic reachability checks.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y iputils-ping dnsutils
----

== Optional but Recommended (Low Overhead)

Small helpers that do not materially increase footprint:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd wget curl
----

These assist in simple health probes and log uploads (if the user enables external reporting).

== Not Required

The following are *not* needed for base operation and should be avoided on constrained hardware unless specifically required:

* GNURadio
* SDRangel / GQRX
* Full desktop environments
* Python scientific stacks (unless using the optional AI module)

== Summary

Minimal install footprint:

* `rtl-sdr` (core)
* `jq` (log handling)
* `usb-modeswitch`, `modemmanager` (modem)
* `ping`, `dig` (network sanity)

This configuration supports core RF checks, GSM registration tests via AT commands, and lightweight local logging without unnecessary overhead.
