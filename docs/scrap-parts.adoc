= Hardware Reuse and Low-Cost Devices

This system is designed to operate using easily available and often repurposed equipment rather than specialized hardware. The intention is to keep the platform accessible & reproducible; The objective is reliable detection of broadcast continuity, not laboratory-grade measurement.

== Typical Reused Components

*RTL-SDR dongle (entry-level)*  
Common DVB-T SDR receivers detect carriers and noise floors sufficiently for broadcast checks (FM, DVB-T, GSM beacon presence, ADS-B noise). Sensitivity is lower than professional hardware but adequate for threshold-based continuity sensing.

*Legacy USB cellular modem*  
Older 3G/2G USB sticks (e.g., early Vodafone or Huawei models) still respond to standard AT commands. Even without an active SIM, they can confirm network visibility, registration attempts, and signal presence.

*Obsolete Wi-Fi extender or access point*  
Used as a passive indicator of local power state. If the extender disappears from scans while external SSIDs remain, the system can infer a localized outage rather than a wide-area event.

*Old Raspberry Pi*  
A Pi from previous generations is sufficient. Baseline requirements: USB host, modest CPU, stable storage. No GPU or modern performance features are necessary.  
A Pi 2/3 or similar SBC handles periodic scans and lightweight processing reliably.
