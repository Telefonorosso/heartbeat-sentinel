= Hardware Reuse and Low-Cost Device Notes

This system is designed to operate using easily available and often repurposed equipment rather than specialized hardware. The intention is to keep the platform accessible, reproducible, and sustainable, and to demonstrate that infrastructure awareness does not require high-end radio gear.

== Device Philosophy

The sensing chain is based on practical constraints: many users already have some combination of old radios, modems, or embedded boards. Accepting modest hardware forces efficient methods and emphasizes signal presence over precision decoding.

The objective is reliable detection of broadcast continuity, not laboratory-grade measurement.

== Typical Reused Components

*RTL-SDR dongle (entry-level)*  
Common DVB-T SDR receivers detect carriers and noise floors sufficiently for broadcast checks (FM, DVB-T, GSM beacon presence, ADS-B noise). Sensitivity is lower than professional hardware but adequate for threshold-based continuity sensing.

*Legacy USB cellular modem*  
Older 3G/2G USB sticks (e.g., early Vodafone or Huawei models) still respond to standard AT commands. Even without an active SIM, they can confirm network visibility, registration attempts, and signal presence.

*Obsolete Wi-Fi extender or access point*  
Used as a passive indicator of local power state. If the extender disappears from scans while external SSIDs remain, the system can infer a localized outage rather than a wide-area event.

*Older Raspberry Pi*  
A Pi from previous generations is sufficient. Baseline requirements: USB host, modest CPU, stable storage. No GPU or modern performance features are necessary.  
A Pi 2/3 or similar SBC handles periodic scans and lightweight processing reliably.

== Practical Notes

Power draw remains low with reused consumer devices. USB peripherals provide basic RF inputs across several bands without additional RF front-ends. Hardware wear or RF limitations are mitigated by averaging, persistence checks, and redundant indicators.

New components can be added, but the baseline design avoids assuming access to specialized radios, calibrated antennas, or current-generation embedded platforms.

== Summary

The system intentionally demonstrates that useful physical-layer awareness can be achieved using surplus consumer equipment. Reuse aligns with accessibility, resilience, and experimentation, while maintaining sufficient performance for continuity sensing objectives.
